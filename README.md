# Mario Kart Randomizer

This application adds a new challenge to the classic Mario Kart game. Different categories can be selected or assigned randomly that tells the player which driver and race courses to pick. Player selections will be stored for future reference. There is also a nifty music search feature that allows players to listen to their favorite Super Mario music while they play!
